public class _172_Factorial_Trailing_Zeroes {

    // core logic: The idea is to count the number of 5 factors in all numbers from 1 to n.
    // Since all trailing 0's are from factors 2 * 5. In n! operation, factors 2 will always be more than factors 5. So we just count the number of 5 factors in all numbers from 1 to n.
    // Example: There are 20 multiples of 5 from 1 to 100, since 100 / 5 = 20. But actually 25 is 5 * 5, so each multiple of 25 has an extra factor of 5 which should also be counted. Since 100 / 25 = 4, there are four multiples of 25 between 1 and 100. Finally, we get 20 + 4 = 24 trailing zeros in 100!.
    // Therefore, we need care about 5 powers as well, to consider additional 5 factors.
    // So it can be computed as:
    // count = (n / 5) + (n / 25) + (n / 125) + ... + 0. Iteration will be terminated when 5^k becomes greater than n.
    // TC: O(logN)
